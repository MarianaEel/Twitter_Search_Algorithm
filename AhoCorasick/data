Next, create an implementation file (typically with a .cpp or similar extension). We'll call the file my_class.cpp and provide a definition for the member declaration. We add an #include directive for "my_class.h" file in order to have the my_class declaration inserted at this point in the .cpp file, and we include <iostream> to pull in the declaration for std::cout. Note that quotes are used for header files in the same directory as the source file, and angle brackets are used for standard library headers. Also, many standard library headers do not have .h or any other file extension.

In the implementation file, we can optionally use a using statement to avoid having to qualify every mention of "my_class" or "cout" with "N::" or "std::". Don't put using statements in your header files!
